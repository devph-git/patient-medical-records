### Change Remote URL

    We changed our repository setup to decouple the frontend and backend. On that note, we are also changing the name of the original repo from patient-medical-records to pmr-0 for the backend; and, in addition, have created an additional repository for the front end: pmr-1.

**_Here are the links:_**

- [https://github.com/devph-git/pmr-0](https://github.com/devph-git/pmr-0)
- [https://github.com/devph-git/pmr-1](https://github.com/devph-git/pmr-1)

To avoid confusion, you'll want to change the URL of your local git origin. To do so, you can run this in your command line:

`git remote set-url https://github.com/devph-git/pmr-0`

or go [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url) for reference.
